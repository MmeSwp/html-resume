<h2>About Me </h2>
    <p>Well, where to start? Honestly, I am all about connecting the right people, learning by doing & doing what I love most: helping people, travelling, and making the most out of everything. </p>
    <p>There is a very creative side in me that loves to create and process something with my own two hands. To me, it does not matter what it is going from drawing, restoring old furniture, Cyanotype prints, Photography, or my latest project web design. Ah! Although the cleaning up afterwards is a lot better after a webpage is created! </p>
    <p>I love to see my hands do. With web design it's the "typing a few words and signs” and see them transform into a page. I like to compare it with turning over the lego-blocks from my past and build a house with those little bricks once more</p>
    <p> When not working, I love to travel, talk, make people smile, create stunning pictures, host a lovely dinner and dare you on the next boardgame. </p>
